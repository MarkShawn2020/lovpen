> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The
  conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user
  requests:

  1. **Initial Request**: User asked me to analyze the codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for
  future Claude Code instances to understand the repository structure and development workflow.

  2. **Codebase Analysis**: I systematically analyzed the project structure:
     - Read package.json files to understand the monorepo structure
     - Examined the pnpm workspace configuration
     - Analyzed the three main packages: obsidian, frontend, shared
     - Checked for configuration files and rules
     - Read key source files to understand the architecture

  3. **CLAUDE.md Creation**: I created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with:
     - Development principles from existing context
     - Project architecture overview
     - Common development commands
     - Technical stack details
     - Plugin development guidelines

  4. **Product Name Update Request**: User informed me that "omnicontent" was the old product name
  and needed to be changed to "lovpen" throughout the codebase. They provided grep output showing
  remaining references.

  5. **Systematic Name Updates**: I updated all references from OmniContent to LovPen across
  multiple files:
     - PRD.md
     - README.md
     - Documentation files
     - CLAUDE.md

  6. **Repository URL Updates**: User pointed out that git remote still pointed to old repository
  name, and wanted all repository references in documentation aligned with the new repository
  structure.

  7. **Final Repository Alignment**: I updated all GitHub repository references from the old
  user/repo to the new markshawn2020/lovpen structure.

  Key technical concepts include: Obsidian plugin development, pnpm monorepo, React/TypeScript
  frontend, content processing pipeline, multi-platform publishing.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     - Initial request: Analyze codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for future Claude Code
  instances
     - Secondary request: Update all references from "OmniContent" to "LovPen" product name
     - Final request: Align all repository references in documentation with the new GitHub
  repository structure (markshawn2020/lovpen)

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Obsidian plugin development architecture
     - pnpm workspace monorepo structure
     - React 19 + TypeScript frontend with Vite build system
     - TailwindCSS 4.x + Radix UI components
     - Jotai state management
     - ESBuild for Obsidian plugin compilation
     - Content processing pipeline: Markdown → HTML → styling → platform adaptation
     - Multi-platform content distribution (WeChat, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu, Twitter)
     - Plugin system for Markdown and HTML processing
     - Template engine using Handlebars
     - Theme and code highlighting system

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/package.json`
       - Root package.json showing monorepo structure with pnpm workspace
       - Scripts for dev, build, check commands across all packages

     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/CLAUDE.md`
       - Created comprehensive development guide including project architecture, commands, and
  development principles
       - Contains specific development principles: "禁止写回退策略", "禁止写测试方案",
  "不允许加重试机制"
       - Updated product name from "OmniContent/LovPen" to just "LovPen"

     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/PRD.md`
       - Updated all product name references from "OmniContent" to "LovPen"
       - Updated maintainer reference from "OmniContent 产品团队" to "LovPen 产品团队"

     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/README.md`
       - Updated product title from "# OmniContent" to "# LovPen"
       - Updated GitHub repository references from sunbooshi/omni-content to markshawn2020/lovpen
       - Updated plugin directory references from obsidian-omnicontent to obsidian-lovpen
       - Updated installation instructions to reference "LovPen 插件"

     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/docs/development/heading-number-feature.md`
       - Updated product reference from "OmniContent 插件" to "LovPen 插件"

     - `/Users/mark/projects/lovpen/packages/obsidian/assets.ts`
       - Updated getThemeURL() method to return new repository URL:
         ```typescript
         getThemeURL() {
             return `https://github.com/markshawn2020/lovpen/releases/download/1.1.3/assets.zip`;
         }
         ```

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - MultiEdit error when trying to replace ".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-omnicontent/" - fixed by
  setting replace_all: true parameter
     - File read error when trying to edit assets.ts - fixed by reading the file first before
  editing

  5. Problem Solving:
     - Systematically identified all OmniContent references using grep output provided by user
     - Updated product branding consistently across all documentation
     - Aligned GitHub repository references with actual git remote configuration
     - Ensured both user-facing documentation and internal code references were updated

  6. All user messages:
     - "/init command to analyze codebase and create CLAUDE.md file"
     - "omnicontent 是旧的产品名，现在改成 lovpen 了" with grep output showing remaining references
     - "我的意思是文档中涉及到repo的也要对齐" pointing out git remote mismatch and need to update
  repository references

  7. Pending Tasks:
     - No explicitly pending tasks remaining

  8. Current Work:
     The most recent work involved updating all GitHub repository references in documentation and
  code to align with the new repository structure. Specifically:
     - Updated README.md GitHub links from sunbooshi/* to markshawn2020/*
     - Updated assets.ts download URL to use the new repository path
     - Ensured all documentation references match the actual git remote configuration

  9. Optional Next Step:
     No next steps are needed as the user's requests have been fully completed. All OmniContent
  references have been updated to LovPen, and all repository references have been aligned with the
  new markshawn2020/lovpen structure..
